# MTA-Turnstile-Data-Visualization-Creator

This project was made when I was taking Data Visualization and Intro to Data Science. 
That is why it uses the same data-set I created as part of my Intro to Data Science Final Project.
Expanding beyond the premise of displaying MTA entry and exit foot traffic, the goal of this project is to display data in multiple graphic ways and allow the person to customize aspects of the graphs.
